# 🔊 WhisperNet  
### AI‑Based Machine Fault Detection System

WhisperNet is an end‑to‑end machine fault detection system that uses **audio signal analysis and machine learning** to detect abnormal machine behavior in real time.  
The system listens to machine sounds, extracts MFCC features, classifies machine health, and visualizes results on a live dashboard.

## 🚀 Problem Statement
Mechanical faults often produce abnormal sounds before complete failure.  
Manual monitoring is inefficient and error‑prone.

**WhisperNet solves this by providing automated, real‑time fault detection using sound.**

---

## 🧠 Solution Overview
WhisperNet continuously listens to machine sounds, processes them using the same feature pipeline used during training, and predicts whether the machine is operating normally or faultily.

Key highlights:
- Real‑time audio capture using ESP32
- MFCC‑based feature extraction
- Machine learning classification
- Live dashboard visualization
- AI‑generated fault explanation and corrective suggestions
